<h1>
  Easy On Me
  </h1>
  <h2>
    by Adele

<p>
  There ain't no gold in this river<br>
That I've been washin' my hands in forever<br>
I know there is hope in these waters<br>
But I can't bring myself to swim<br>
When I am drowning in this silence<br>
Baby, let me in<br>
Go easy on me, baby<br>
I was still a child<br>
Didn't get the chance to<br>
Feel the world around me<br>
I had no time to choose<br>
What I chose to do<br>
So go easy on me<br>
There ain't no room for things to change<br>
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways<br>
You can't deny how hard I've tried<br>
I changed who I was to put you both first<br>
But now I give up<br>
Go easy on me, baby<br>
I was still a child<br>
Didn't get the chance to<br>
Feel the world around me<br>
Had no time to choose<br>
What I chose to do<br>
So go easy on me<br>
I had good intentions<br>
And the highest hopes<br>
But I know right now<br>
It probably doesn't even show<br>
Go easy on me, baby<br>
I was still a child<br>
I didn't get the chance to<br>
Feel the world around me<br>
I had no time to choose<br>
What I chose to do<br>
So go easy on me<br>
